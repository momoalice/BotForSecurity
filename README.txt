BotForSecurity

I develop this Bot based on Slack. This Bot can execute 5 different commands and there is hierarchy among these commands. The user can only excute some command after excecuting another one so that we make sure there would be less input error (i.e. random wrong ID user makes up). The Bot would know whether this command is directed towards it in a channel by checking the mention.

Here are the commands:

1. Counts: return how many data entries do we have. Optional third param: how many entries do you want to see (randomly selected).
         subcommand: Sample <NUM>
2. Severity: Get events with specified severity (low, medium, high). Optional third param: how many entries do you want to see (randomly selected).
         subcommand: Specific <ID>
3. Search: Search for a specific keyword and get info
         subcommand: Specific <ID>

The subcommand could only be executed right after the master command be executed. However, if a user wrongly give parameter to a subcommand, he could still try this subcommand although it is not right after the master command.

If the user enter an invalid command that is undefined, the Bot would output all the commands again to remind the user about the correct command.

The behaviors of different command:
1. Counts:
This command simply asks the Bot to output how many CVE entries 
1.1 Sample
This command sample some random CVE descriptions to let the user get some idea what kind of data we have in our database

2. Severity
This command gives the user the information of all the CVE entries that has the severities the user specified. The user may be interested in events that have a certain severity. There are three levels: (low, medium, high). Note that not all CVE entries contain severity info so we have to do exception check to prevent the program from crashing. Because there might be many entries, the user has the choice to specify how many entries they want to at this time.
2.1 Specific
After seeing a list of events, the user can spefify to see one specific one by it's ID. We will give more detailed info about that event, including the reference links so that user could get some outside source. But we still handle the situation where user 

3. Search
The user could search for a specific keyword in the description of events because they might be interested in a specific company or website or product.  Because there might be many entries, the user has the choice to specify how many entries they want to at this time.
3.1 Specific
Same with the Specific in Severity.

Testing:

I implemented them by first created the skeleton that specify all the command I want to implement and then implement them one by one. For each functionality, I refract out the kernal code for it into a new helper method so that I could later maintain it and modify it more easily without creating destruction to other part. I tested each one of them after finishing its implementation. After finishing all the functionalities of it, I tested it integratively on Slack also. 

Unit test: I first test whether the token is correctly set up so that Bot could be connected sucessfully. I then finished the unit test for Counts functionality. Finish the testing for Specific, Search, Severity functionality. Especially need testing when the user give an invalid input. (All unit tests finished. Fix multiple bugs in my code)
